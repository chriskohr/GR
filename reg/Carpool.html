Safety &amp; Carpool Procedures</b></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>Our goal
is to provide our children with the safest possible traffic environment at and around Glorietta
School.</b> During
the first few weeks of school when most students are
“Early Birds” (except Kindergarteners), carpool
traffic is very heavy. It is especially important to allow sufficient
time to get to school and to obey all the safety rules. (This also
applies throughout the year on Mondays when all students are on the
“Early Bird” schedule.) To ensure the
efficiency of
Glorietta’s carpool system, please follow the procedures
outlined
below.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>CARPOOLING:</b></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt">
      <ol style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma; FONT-SIZE: 13pt">
        <li>Drop off/pick up children ONLY in the 
        designated carpool area, which is the main school parking lot in front 
        of the school office. Do not allow your child/ren to exit your vehicle 
        along Martha Road or Hillcrest. 
        <li>When approaching the school for carpool drop 
        off/pick up, always proceed to the turnaround near the UPPER parking lot 
        and then enter the main school parking lot after coming back down Martha 
        Road. 
        <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">PLEASE DISCONTINUE
CELL PHONE USE PRIOR TO ENTERING THE CARPOOL AREA.</span>
        <li>After entering the carpool area, always proceed 
        to the furthest available spot in the carpool line. This allows as many 
        cars as possible to enter the drop off/pick up area at one time. Please 
        pay attention and follow the directions of the staff member on carpool 
        duty. 
        <li>Please <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">DO NOT LEAVE
YOUR VEHICLE UNATTENDED</span> in the 
        carpool area. It is hazardous to others if a parked car is blocking the 
        traffic flow. The staff member will locate and escort your child/ren to 
        your vehicle. 
        <li>Please <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">STAY IN YOUR
VEHICLE</span> when dropping 
        off/picking up your child/ren. The staff member will assist your 
        child/ren in getting into the vehicle if necessary. 
        <li>All students have a designated area to sit and 
        wait for their rides. First, second, and third grade students are in the 
        hallway on your right as you enter the driveway in front of the school. 
        The fourth and fifth grade students are seated on the benches directly 
        in front of the main office. All the children are seated and facing the 
        driveway looking for their rides. 
        <li>When exiting the parking lot, always turn RIGHT 
        onto Martha Road. 
        <li>Remember that children need to exit on the 
        right side of the vehicle, so please take this into consideration when 
        making seating arrangements. 
        <li>Always make sure everyone in your vehicle is 
        wearing a seat belt. 
        <li>Please review these procedures with anyone who will be
handling carpool at Glorietta for you.</li>
