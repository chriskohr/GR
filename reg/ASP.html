      The After School Enrichment Program (ASE) at Glorietta is a 
terrific way to enrich your child's Glorietta experience! We 
offer a wide and varied selection of fee-based activities that 
support your kids' favorite hobbies and expose them to new 
ones. It's a great way for them to connect with old friends and 
make new ones with common interests.

	   NEW this year, we have planned the full year's ASE schedule in
advance! We hope this will allow you to find your favorite 
classes now and plan around them. Many classes will NOT be 
offered in all 3 sessions, and some will change days from one 
session to the next, so if you see a class you like, be sure to 
allow for it in your schedule when it is offered. To see the new 
schedule now, click here.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">    
We are excited to offer many new offerings in the ASE program
this year, as well as many of your favorites from years past. 
Included this year are <b>Berkeley Chess School, Bay Area 
Children's Theater, Critters N Clay and VisionTech,</b> and 
new vendors include <b>All West Lacrosse, Make Me A Pro 
Sports, Sarah Science, and Village Music,</b> to name a few. 
There is sure to be something for everyone! ASE will also 
feature a <b>Homework Club</b> this year, taught by some of our very
own beloved Glorietta teachers.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">
Most classes, with a few exceptions, will be offered from 3:30 pm. to 4:30 pm. On Early Release Mondays, classes will begin 
at 2:30 pm. Each session will also offer one Kinder-Only class 
at 2:00 pm, which will rotate by session. We encourage you 
send your students to Gopher Club while awaiting the start of 
their ASE Classes.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">
Courses begin in October and are offered in Fall, Winter, and 
Spring sessions. They fall under the categories of Fine Arts, 
Performing Arts, Home Economics, Sports, and Science and 
Games. Classes are offered by highly-respected, award-winning
vendors, all right here on our own Glorietta campus! Most 
courses will meet 7 to 9 times, based on the school holiday 
calendar. New this year, we will also offer some 4 class minisessions-just as much fun, with less commitment!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">
Registration for each of the three sessions is conducted 
separately through the on-line <a href="http://gloriettaparentsclub.revtrak.net/tek9.asp">Glorietta RevTrak Store</a>. Check
