The After School Enrichment Program (ASE) at Glorietta is a terrific way to enrich your child's Glorietta experience!  We offer a wide and varied selection of fee-based activities that support your kids' favorite hobbies and expose them to new ones.  It's a great way for them to connect with old friends and make new ones with common interests.
<br><br>
	  NEW this year, we have planned the full year's ASE schedule in advance!  We hope this will allow you to find your favorite classes now and plan around them.  Many classes will NOT be offered in all 3 sessions, and some will change days from one session to the next, so if you see a class you like, be sure to allow for it in your schedule when it is offered.  To see the new schedule now, <a href="http://gl-orinda-ca.schoolloop.com/file/1335087725026/1365836133389/2380007566148872907.pdf" target="_new">click here</a>.
<br><br>
We are excited to offer many new offerings in the ASE program this year, as well as many of your favorites from years past.  Included this year are <b>Berkeley Chess School, Bay Area Children's Theater, Critters N Clay and VisionTech,</b> and new vendors include <b>All West Lacrosse, Make Me A Pro Sports, Sarah Science, and Village Music,</b> to name a few.  There is sure to be something for everyone!  ASE will also feature a <b>Homework Club</b> this year, taught by some of our very own beloved Glorietta teachers.
<br><br>
Most classes, with a few exceptions, will be offered from 3:30 pm. to 4:30 pm.  On Early Release Mondays, classes will begin at 2:30 pm.  Each session will also offer one Kinder-Only class at 2:00 pm, which will rotate by session.  We encourage you send your students to Gopher Club while awaiting the start of their ASE Classes.
<br><br>
Courses begin in October and are offered in Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions.  They fall under the categories of Fine Arts, Performing Arts, Home Economics, Sports, and Science and Games.  Classes are offered by highly-respected, award-winning vendors, all right here on our own Glorietta campus!  Most courses will meet 7 to 9 times, based on the school holiday calendar.  New this year, we will also offer some 4 class mini-sessions-just as much fun, with less commitment!
<br><br>
Registration for each of the three sessions is conducted separately through the on-line Glorietta RevTrak Store.  Check the Gabette and Glorietta e-mails for deadlines, reminders, and updates.
