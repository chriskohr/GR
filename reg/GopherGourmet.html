Gopher Gourmet is open five days a week for lunch and provides our students with

healthy, nutritious and delicious food choices at reasonable prices. All profits from this 

parent-run, volunteered-staffed operation go to the GPC to fund many services that 

support the ongoing maintenance of our campus, classroom supplies and safety of 

our students, as well as our P.E. programs, classroom assistants and other curriculum 

enhancements.</p>

      style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>Gopher Gourmet Menu</b></font><br>
A typical Gopher Gourmet daily menu includes several choices for pre-ordered hot

entrées, including options that are vegetarian and gluten-free, a beverage, and the very 

popular Variety Bar.  Our Variety Bar is stocked with enough healthy and varied items to 

create a well-balanced meal, like fresh green salads, an array of fruits and vegetables, 

condiments, dairy options, protein sources and whole grain options.  Students can 

select either meals including both the hot entrées and the Variety Bar or select the 

Variety Bar alone.
<br><br>
The variety bar will feature a <b>special hot protein item</b>, such as mini corn dogs, 

meatballs, fish sticks or mini chicken tacos, that will <b>only be available to those 

students who order "Variety Bar Only"</b>.  Students who order the entrée 

option will continue to have access to the variety bar but will not receive the special hot 

item of the day.

We have partnered with Safeway to offer sushi on Mondays and Round Table to

offer pizza on Thursdays.

      style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>Volunteering - we cannot run this program without you!</b></font><br>
Thank you for volunteering to serve great, healthy food to our children!  By volunteering

your time, you are supporting a lunch program that will provide Glorietta's students with 

over 50,000 varied and nutritious meals this year.  Volunteering also provides the added 

benefits of getting to know other Glorietta parents and seeing your children in a fun, 

social environment.

      style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>How I can help?</b></font><br>
	  <b>Kitchen volunteer:</b>  This person works in a team and is responsible for prepping 

food for the variety bar, serving lunch to our hungry kids and cleaning up. No food 

handling experience is necessary! Each shift lasts approximately 3.5 hours, from 

10:15am to 1:45pm.
<br><br>
<b>Trader Joes:</b>  This job includes picking up and paying for our order (groceries) at the 

customer service booth at Trader Joes in Lafayette and dropping off in the kitchen by 

9:00am on Monday. You will be reimbursed for the groceries.
<br><br>
<b>Sushi:</b>  On Mondays, this person will pick up and pay for sushi at the Safeway in 

Orinda at 10:45am and delivery to the kitchen by 11:15am. You will be reimbursed for 

the sushi. 
<br><br>
<b>Laundry:</b>  On Friday afternoon (after 2pm), pick up the dirty laundry outside of the 

kitchen, launder and return it clean to the kitchen by 9am on Monday.
<br><br>
<b>Bagel Pick Up:</b>  This job includes picking up bagels from Noah's in Lafayette and 

dropping off in the kitchen by 10am on Tuesdays.

	  
</p><p style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma" class="MsoNormal">
<span 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"><b>Reminder for Volunteers:</b></font><br>
	  When it's your turn to volunteer, please remember to arrive in the kitchen on time ready

to work by 10:15am and plan to stay for the entire shift, until 1:45pm.  Not completing 

a full shift puts an extra burden on your team and the rest of the kitchen staff.  

<b>It 

also increases our operating expenses because we have to pay our 

kitchen manager to work longer shifts.  This means less money for 

our kids and the GPC.</b>
